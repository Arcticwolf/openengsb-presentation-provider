===============================

This project's purpose is the first half of the thesis validation code of Felix Mayerhuber, containing test code for the model transformation unit of the OpenEngSB project. It contains all model definitions and additional code which is needed by the presentation bundle.

This bundle has been reimplemented to fit the standard domain/connector format of the OpenEngSB project. The new implementation of this bundle is now a domain bundle and is located under the link: https://github.com/Arcticwolf/openengsb-domain-presentation.

There is also the usage guide located
